      <p>Like the rest of human life, the field of psychiatry is constantly changing. Most of the medications I use today were not in existence when I finished my residency. It is important for a psychiatrist to keep up with new developments. To this end, I read several journals and newsletters, and I obtain my continuing medical education hours from sources that are independent of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
      <p>I look forward to meeting with you and delivering the highest quality care.</p>
